# Uncommon Error in MATLAB Function: Edge Case Handling and Unexpected Results

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in a MATLAB function that arises from improper handling of edge cases and potential unexpected results from complex calculations. The function `myFunction` checks for negative input, but might still encounter errors due to issues in the internal calculations.  The internal function `someCalculation` contains a potential division-by-zero error. This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and robust error handling in MATLAB code.

## Bug Description
The function `myFunction` is designed to perform a calculation on its input. However, it may fail due to two issues:

1.  **Incomplete error handling:** The input validation only addresses negative inputs, and may not handle all conditions leading to errors.
2.  **Unexpected results from calculation:** The `someCalculation` function may produce unexpected results, such as `Inf` or `NaN`, depending on the input, which are not handled by `myFunction`.

## Solution
The solution focuses on enhancing the error handling and robustness of the calculations in the functions. The solution involves comprehensive input validation to handle edge cases that could cause the function to fail and adding appropriate error checks and handling mechanisms to address potential issues within the `someCalculation` function.
